## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learned how to use the ``` <picture></picture> ``` tag to contain different images for different screens. And I have also learned how to fit the image within its container like fitting a background image in its container using:
```css
img {
  display: block;
  max-width: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
} 
```
