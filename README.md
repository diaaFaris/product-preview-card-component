## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use images between desktop and mobile. On desktop I make the width of the image as 100% and the height will be automatically adjusted and hiding the mobile image.  While on mobile we hide the desktop image and render the mobile image, the mobile image should be a square in dimensions so we add the width as 100% and the height is going to automatically match the width since their aspect ration is 1:1.
